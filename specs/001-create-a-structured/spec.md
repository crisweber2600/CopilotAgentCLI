# Feature Specification: Plan‑to‑Execution Orchestrator

**Feature Branch**: `[001-create-a-structured]`
**Created**: 2025‑09‑19
**Status**: **Final**
**Input**: User description: "create a structured way to turn high-level plans into clear, step-by-step workflows that can be reliably executed. It aims to eliminate duplicate effort, ensure work moves forward without unnecessary delays, and make progress visible at all times. The approach emphasizes keeping history consistent, guaranteeing quality through clear definitions of completion, and maintaining accountability for every step taken. Success will be measured by how smoothly tasks flow from start to finish, how quickly they reach completion, and how well the system recovers from interruptions or conflicts. Policies will guide how work is prioritized, reviewed, and released, while also ensuring fairness, transparency, and security. Built-in monitoring will allow stakeholders to see where work stands, what has been accomplished, and what still needs attention. The proposal also defines clear processes for normal progress, parallel teamwork, recovery from stalls, and escalation when human input is required. By combining clarity, consistency, and accountability, the system provides a reliable framework for turning intent into coordinated, high-quality results."

- ❌ No tech stacks, APIs, or code structure.
- 👥 Written for **business stakeholders**.
- Remove sections that don’t apply (no “N/A”).

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a **stakeholder** (initiator, contributor, reviewer, approver, observer), I want high‑level plans translated into **ordered steps** with **clear exit criteria**, executed **in sequence by default**, and when steps are **parallelizable**, they are **triggered concurrently** across available executors with **deterministic launch order**, so progress is smooth, visible, and auditable.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a workflow with ordered steps (1..n) and exit criteria, **When** a work item progresses, **Then** steps run in ascending order unless marked parallelizable and all dependencies are met.
2. **Given** steps _B_ and _C_ are marked **parallelizable** and become ready after _A_, **When** scheduling runs and executors are available, **Then** _B_ and _C_ are **triggered concurrently** to different executors with **launch order = ascending step index**; both must finish before _D_ starts.
3. **Given** multiple **non‑parallelizable** steps are eligible, **When** scheduling occurs, **Then** only the **lowest‑order** step is started; higher steps wait (no preemption).
4. **Given** multiple executors exist, **When** an executor **claims** a task, **Then** that task is **exclusively assigned** to that executor until a terminal state (completed/rejected/rework) is reached; no other executor can claim the same attempt.
5. **Given** potential duplicates exist, **When** the **human pre‑handoff reviewer** evaluates them, **Then** they may merge/link/close with recorded rationale **before** any worker execution.
6. **Given** a review/release gate is reached, **When** a reviewer **rejects** with reasons, **Then** the item returns to the specified earlier step; re‑entry criteria are re‑checked; rework is quantified.
7. **Given** a step completes, **When** its results are finalized, **Then** a **handoff artifact (file)** is **committed** for that step/event, and the **next agent** consumes it to proceed (“notification by artifact”).
8. **Given** an interruption or handoff occurs, **When** work resumes, **Then** the system restores prior state and lists remaining exit criteria that must be re‑verified.

### Edge Cases

- Two parallelizable steps contend for the same shared constraint → serialize with recorded scheduling decision.
- Equal order indices among parallel steps → stable **lexical tie‑break** by step key; recorded for audit.
- Handoff artifact missing/unreadable → block progression and provide a clear recovery path.
- Workflow definition changes mid‑flight → versioned migration with explicit mapping.
- Duplicate suspicion overturned during human review → override allowed with rationale.
- Executor failure mid‑task → task attempt reaches failure state; **new attempt** is explicitly re‑queued (history preserved).

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR‑001**: Allow stakeholders to define reusable **Workflows** with ordered **Steps** (1..n); each step defines entry criteria, exit criteria, and a business‑level Definition of Done.
- **FR‑002**: Register **Work Items** to exactly one active Workflow at a time and display current step, next step, and remaining exit criteria.
- **FR‑003**: Provide a **human pre‑handoff review gate** before worker execution to merge/link/close suspected duplicates with recorded rationale. _(No automated duplicate detection required for MVP.)_
- **FR‑004**: Support **parallelizable steps** that may run **concurrently** once dependencies are satisfied, and **joins** that require ALL required parallel branches to complete before proceeding.
- **FR‑005**: Produce a **deterministic schedule**:

  1. Default is **sequential** by step order.
  2. **Parallelizable** ready steps are **triggered concurrently**; **launch order** is ascending step order (for auditability).
  3. **No preemption** mid‑step; a running task must reach a terminal state before reassignment.
  4. **Tie‑break** for equal order indices uses **stable lexical order by step key**.
  5. Concurrency per work item is bounded only by **ready parallelizable steps** and **available executors**.

- **FR‑006**: Enforce **review and release gates** with approve/reject outcomes, reasons, and timestamped sign‑offs.
- **FR‑007**: **Out of scope**: real‑time dashboards (status retrieved on demand is sufficient).
- **FR‑008**: **Out of scope**: time‑based stall detection and automated recovery actions.
- **FR‑009**: Maintain **tamper‑evident history** of status changes, decisions, assignments, attempts, and joins; corrections are additive and linked to the corrected record.
- **FR‑010**: Define the **rework/idempotency boundary**: outputs are **provisional** until **Baseline Integration** (“merge to base branch” business event).

  - Before integration: steps may be re‑executed;
  - After integration: rework requires an **explicit revert** decision that restores pre‑integration state prior to re‑execution;
  - Re‑executing a step with unchanged inputs must not create duplicate effects.

- **FR‑011**: Record **accountability** per step (responsible role/owner) and track ownership transfers with reasons and timestamps.
- **FR‑012**: Provide **blocker management** (declare, classify, resolve) and show impact on timelines and flow metrics.
- **FR‑013**: Measure and display **flow metrics**: lead time, cycle time (per step), throughput, WIP, rework rate; provide portfolio roll‑ups with drill‑down to item history.
- **FR‑014**: Use **handoff artifacts (files)** as the notification mechanism. On specified events the system **commits an artifact** to a **durable shared workspace** that the **next agent** reads to proceed.
  **Required artifact fields (business‑level):** Work Item ID; Workflow name/version; Step key & order; Event type; Attempt ID; Timestamp; Actor; Outcome summary; Next required action; Baseline‑integration flag (pre/post); Link(s) to prior artifacts; Artifact schema version.
- **FR‑015**: Provide **explainable status** for each item: why it is in the current step, remaining criteria, pending parallel branches, and the next required action.
- **FR‑016**: Support **workflow versioning** with effective dates and **migration plans** for in‑flight items, including rollback paths.
- **FR‑017**: Provide **portfolio visibility** via on‑demand views and exports with filters (time, owner, workflow, status).
- **FR‑018**: **Out of scope**: advanced access/visibility policy modeling beyond basic role/ownership.
- **FR‑019**: **Out of scope**: fairness guardrails (caps/rotations/quotas).
- **FR‑020**: **Out of scope**: escalations beyond manual human action.
- **FR‑021**: Support **rework**: send items backward with recorded reasons; re‑entry criteria must be re‑evaluated; quantify rework.
- **FR‑022**: Provide **change logs** for workflow/policy edits including author, reason, and impact notes visible to stakeholders.
- **FR‑023**: **Out of scope**: extended data retention/archival policies beyond baseline audit history for items, decisions, and artifacts.
- **FR‑024**: **Out of scope**: explicit performance/scale targets for MVP.
- **FR‑025**: Define **error handling behaviors** for policy conflicts, missing required data, invalid workflow states, and **artifact read/write failures**, each with a user‑visible recovery path.
- **FR‑026**: Provide **reporting/export** with drill‑down from portfolio to item history and associated artifacts.
- **FR‑027**: Enforce **exclusive assignment semantics**: once an executor **claims** a task attempt, it becomes **ineligible** for other executors until terminal state; retries create a **new attempt** and are explicitly re‑queued (prior attempts remain in history).

---

* **FR‑028**: Assume executor isolation (executors do not share runtime state). Coordination and handoffs MUST occur only via the durable shared workspace and recorded artifacts/decisions; orchestration for a given work item MUST run one at a time.
* **FR‑029**: Support two persistence patterns for recording results while preserving auditability and exclusive assignment:
  1) Producers commit handoff artifacts directly upon completion.
  2) A downstream collector commits a batch of handoff artifacts after execution completes. Both patterns MUST yield equivalent history and not violate deterministic sequencing.

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Workflow**: Versioned blueprint describing ordered steps, parallelization flags, joins, gates, and success criteria.
- **Step**: Unit of work with entry/exit criteria, order index, optional parallelizable flag, and responsible role.
- **Work Item**: The unit moving through a workflow; has status, ownership, dependency links, timestamps.
- **Executor**: Member of the executor pool; processes **one task at a time**.
- **Assignment**: Exclusive pairing of a **task attempt** with an executor (claimed_at, released_at, terminal_state).
- **Attempt**: A single execution try of a step for a work item (attempt_id, parent step/work item, status, start/end times, artifact links).
- **Gate Review**: Approval/rejection event with reasons and required follow‑ups.
- **Scheduling Decision**: Recorded application of FR‑005 rules (what was ready, launch order, assignment, start/finish).
- **Handoff Artifact**: Durable file committed per specified event containing outcome, next action, provenance, attempt id, and linkages.
- **Baseline Integration**: Business event marking when outcomes become part of the authoritative baseline (commonly realized as “merge to base branch”); defines the rework boundary.
- **Blocker**: Declared impediment with type, start/end times, owner, and resolution notes.
- **Audit Record**: Immutable entry capturing who/what/when/why for state changes, decisions, assignments, artifacts, and access.
- **Metric Set**: Observed KPIs for items/workflows; supports drill‑down.
